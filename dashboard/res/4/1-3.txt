Thinking about my future
Do I want to be rich? Why?
"My mom and dad will like it if I become rich"
"My grandparents have put in quite some money into my studies"
"My parents have done a lot and put in money into my studies"
"Dad's business is about to close."
I am dead set on taking transfer, I'm not gonna stop. All the way through to the US to get the best of an education.
Lazyness?
Want to settle in US. Why? Grandpa comfortable there. Want to support him. Better health in US.
Want dad to stop business stress, if any and enjoy life. I want to become the cheif bread bringer.
Suhani should get highest quality of education. I should pay those fees. I wish to pay fees for her uni also. Wish sunni goes to an ivy league college/med school. She is also all about studies and no sports. Only way she can make money is good job in tech/med
->For all these reasons, I need to get good money >> Good job >> Good uni
VIT doesnt NEARLY cut it, as its in India and most likely we will be going to US through file.
Also, I want to move to US, much because of the car scene: custom cars, car meets etc. There's nothing similar in India.
